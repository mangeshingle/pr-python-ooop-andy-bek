## Define a new type called DNABase which takes a single arg (nucleotide) at initiation

## Internally the value specified in the nucleotide arg should be validated and standardized

## The class should expose the nucleotide in an attribute called base

## The new type should have a full representation

## A user should be able to specify either the full name as above, or the first letter, caseinsensitively

## The valid bases are: adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine

## The name exposed under the base attribute should be the full name in lowercaseregardless of how it was specified

## Invalid or otherwise unrecognized bases should be rejected, whether they arespecified at instance creation or later altered through attribute setters
